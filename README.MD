# Default RPC 
   There is a file called `defaultRPC.json` IN there you can make your custom RPC, and then share that file to others so they have the same RPC as you. 

   To make a button IN there you need this line `"buttons": [{ "label": "Take me to the github", "url": "https://github.com/Mini51/DiscordRPC/"}],`

   Put it at the top of the file like in this example image
